    "Cymbal Direct, the retail arm of Cymbal, wants to leverage the power of Gemini 2.5 Flash to gain a competitive edge in the basketball sneaker market. They aim to analyze competitor pricing, understand customer preferences, and generate synthetic data for testing new ecommerce features. You, as a data analyst, are tasked with using Gemini's capabilities to help Cymbal Direct achieve these goals. This will involve:\n",
    "  * **Code Execution**: Demonstrate the ability to execute Python code within Gemini 2.5 Flash\n",
    "  * **Grounding**: Use grounding to enhance the accuracy and relevance of Gemini's responses to questions about retail products.\n",
    "  * **Controlled Generation**: Retrieve information about basketball sneakers and their pricing from competitors using Google Search.\n",
    "  * **Synthetic Data Generation**: Structure the extracted product and pricing information into a predefined JSON schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to provide Cymbal Direct with actionable insights to refine their marketing strategy, improve their products, and bolster product positioning. Are you ready for the challenge?"

Its slightly open weave allows light to pass through, contributing to its lightweight aesthetic.\n",
      "*   **Full-Length Zoom Air Strobel Unit** A full-length Zoom Air Strobel unit is stitched directly to the upper, placing the cushioning directly underfoot for enhanced responsiveness and a closer-to-the-ground feel.\n",
      "*   **Forefoot Zoom Air Unit** In addition to the Strobel unit, a large Zoom Air unit is strategically placed under the forefoot, providing an extra boost of responsiveness and bounce.\n",
      "*   **Hollowed-Out Eclipse Plate** The Eclipse Plate, carried over from previous Jordan models (like the 34 and 35), is further refined in the XXXVI. It's hollowed out between the midsole and outsole, reducing weight and exposing the shoe's stabilizing shank, which helps prevent twisting.\n",
      "*   **Herringbone Traction Pattern** The outsole features a durable herringbone traction pattern with thick grooves, a tried-and-true design that ensures multi-directional grip and helps prevent dust clogging.\n",
      "*   **Lightweight Construction** The overall design prioritizes weight reduction, with elements like the leno-weave upper, perforated sockliner, and refined Eclipse Plate contributing to making it one of the lightest Air Jordans to date.\n",
      "*   **Design Homage to Air Jordan 6** The Air Jordan XXXVI incorporates subtle design cues from the iconic Air Jordan 6, such as a heel tab and lace covering, as an homage to the shoe Michael Jordan wore when he won his first championship.\n",
      "*   **Flexible Tongue with Padding** Both high and low-top versions include a flexible tongue with padding to help reduce pressure from the laces on the ankle and foot.\n"
